In this page I will collect links to other video games or game frameworks about Special Relativity.
I sort all entries from the most recent to the oldest.

# Other Special Relativity games or frameworks

- [Relativity for games](https://academic.oup.com/ptep/article/2017/11/113J01/4676040)
  A space shooter game, also downloadable from [GitHub](https://github.com/sogebu/LSBattle)
- MIT’s [A Slower speed of light](http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/).
  This game/framework focuses very much on the perceived effects due to light propagation.
  The game includes doppler shift, distortions due to light propagation, such as the
  [Terrel-Penrose effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation).
  The game was developed with Unity around 2013 and later.
- [Velocity raptor, playable online](https://www.sciencegamecenter.org/games/velocity-raptor).
  This is a 2D game developed by [TestTubeGames](https://testtubegames.com/) around 2011.
  It has the ability of showing classical and relativistic views of the same situation.
  It also distinguishes between the measured world and the perceived world.
- "Designing a Computer Game to Teach Einstein's Theory of Relativity".
  This is an [oldish paper from 2007](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4293657).
  The advertised game is a variant of the “asteroid” arcade game.
