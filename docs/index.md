This site collects ideas, experiments and thoughts emerging while developing
a video game about Special Relativity.

See the **[Articles section](articles)** for formulas an techniques I use in the game.

I am also sharing progress I made on the project on various social media:

- [Day-to-day development on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/relativisticg)
- [Weekly progress updates and demos on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/relativisticgame)
- [Random videos on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@relativisticgame)
- [Longer videos on selected topics in YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@relativisticgame)

At the moment, there isn't much content in there, but this will slowly change over time
as I make progress with this project.
