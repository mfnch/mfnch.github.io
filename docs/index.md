I created a **playable simulation**/**mini-game** that let's you explore what happens
when travelling close to the speed of light. It runs on your browser.
Just **click the image below** to open it on the Itch website.

I created this mini-game together with a video which I published on
[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@relativisticgame) and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@relativisticgame). I recommend watching the video
before trying the mini-game.
